# Darian_Variant_Calculator
Calculator made in JavaScript(Android Studio)

The scope of this project was to familiarize with the IDE's of Google and JetBrains for android apps developing.

The design app was made using XML and the functionality of the buttons was made using Java.

To calculate the expression I used rhino library.

Tutorial:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3KQdwVlo1Q&t=3s 

  The design app I have is the same as in the tutorial but I added an dark mode extension. On the other hand, the Java file is changed because in the video
the string is not evaluated correctly, you can put for example "1+-2/-2" and this is a wrong expression. I modify the Java file so that the user can properly 
use the calculator.
